# String Project

### Objective
Create a string manipulation program that covers the concepts of string operations in Python.

### Problem
Develop a Python program that allows users to input a string and perform operations such as finding the minimum and maximum characters, sorting the characters in the string, etc.

### Implementation
- Ask the user to enter a string. 
- Find the minimum character in the entered string.
- Find the maximum character in the string.
- Count the occurrences of a specific character or substring in the string.
- Check if it starts with a specific substring.
- Check if it ends with a specific substring.
- Sort the characters in the string in ascending order.
- Convert the string to lowercase.
- Capitalize the first character of each word in the string.  

### Use case
```
Enter a string: Hello World
Minimum character:  
Maximum character: r
Enter a character to count: l
Occurrences of 'l': 3
Enter a substring to check at the start: Hello
Enter a substring to check at the end: World
Starts with 'Hello': True
Ends with 'World': True
Sorted characters:  Wdellhoor
Lowercase conversion: hello world
Capitalized first character: Hello world
```


### Qualification to pass
- The program should correctly identify and display the minimum and maximum characters in the input string.
- The program should count and display the occurrences of a specific character in the input string.
- The program should check if the input string starts and ends with a specific substring.
- The program should sort the characters in the input string in ascending order and display the sorted string.
- The program should convert the input string to lowercase and display the result.
- The program should capitalize the first character of each word in the input string and display the result.
